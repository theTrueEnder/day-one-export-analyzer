# Day One Export Analyzer
*A tool to examine statistics and trends of metadata for exports of the [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/) journaling app.*

This tool was created entirely for fun and for my own benefit, primarily to see a graph of when I went to sleep over the past three years. If anyone else actually uses this or wants a certain feature, contact me and I'll be happy to take a look or just hear that anyone actually used it!

I love Python.

## How to use this thing

It's pretty simple. Make sure you already have Python installed, as well as `matplotlib`, `datetime`, and `pytz`.
```c
analyzer.py [-h] --a {completed,created} [--f [FILE]]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --analyzer {completed,created}, -a {completed,created}
                        sets the mode of the analyzer
  --file [FILE], -f [FILE]
                        filename or path to the Day One journal .json file
```

In other words, run `python analyzer.py -a completed -f journal.py` (or whatever you named your journal export). Change the analyzer mode to your heart's desire. My heart desires to see how late I've stayed up over the past few years. Make sure you extracted your journal if you exported it using the `.zip` option.
